# SUMMARY
# ==============================================================================

summary: |
  ALL APPS IN DNS SYSTEM MUST HAVE:
  
  1. ✅ Help & Support UI
     - Searchable, organized help content
     - FAQ, troubleshooting, getting started
     - Contact support functionality
     - Easy to access (Profile → Help & Support)
  
  2. ✅ Privacy Policy (Developer-Protecting)
     - Clearly state what you DON'T collect
     - Emphasize local storage and minimal data
     - List all third-party services
     - Include strongest liability protections
     - Plain English summary
  
  3. ✅ Terms of Service (Developer-Protecting)
     - Strongest possible disclaimers
     - Maximum liability limitations
     - Clear user responsibilities
     - Indemnification clause
     - Domain-specific disclaimers (legal, medical, etc.)
     - Plain English summary
  
  WHY THIS MATTERS:
  - Meets App Store/Play Store requirements
  - PROTECTS YOU from legal liability
  - Reduces support burden (good help docs)
  - Builds user trust and professionalism
  - Prevents misuse and abuse
  
  USE VISAPRO AS TEMPLATE:
  All three components (Help UI, Privacy, Terms) are production-ready
  and can be adapted for any app type.
