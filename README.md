# easylearning

Learning data repository for the app.

## Contents

This repository contains learning data in the `jpleanrning/` folder.

## Data Structure

- Category-based structure
- All JLPT levels (N5-N1)
- JSON format

## How It Works

1. The app downloads these JSON files on first launch
2. Data is cached locally on the device for offline use
3. App checks for updates periodically
4. Users only download what they need

## Updating Content

To update the learning data:

1. Edit the JSON files locally in your project's `jpleanrning/` folder
2. Update the version in `jpleanrning/manifest.json`
3. Run the upload script from your project
4. Users automatically receive updates

## Current Version

Check `jpleanrning/manifest.json` for the current version.
