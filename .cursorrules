# Project Rules for auto_swift_nplearn Repository

## GitHub Push Policy - CRITICAL RULE

**⚠️ ONLY push DATA FOLDERS to GitHub, NEVER push app source code or toolkits!**

### What to push to GitHub:
✅ `jpleanrning/` - Japanese learning data (JSON files only)
✅ `nplearning/` - Nepali learning data (JSON files only)
✅ `README.md` - Repository documentation
✅ `.gitignore` - Git configuration

### What to NEVER push to GitHub:
❌ `NPLearn/` - App source code (keep local only)
❌ `JPLearning/` - App source code (keep local only)
❌ `nplearn_auto_data/` - Data generation toolkit (keep local only)
❌ `.dns_system/` - System files (keep local only)
❌ `auto_app_data generation/` - Old toolkit (keep local only)
❌ Any app source code, Xcode projects, or development tools

### The Repository Purpose:
This GitHub repository (https://github.com/dnsmalla/easylearning) is a **pure data source** for apps to fetch learning content from. It should contain ONLY JSON data files.

### Before Every Git Push:
1. Check `git status` and verify ONLY data folders are being pushed
2. If you see app source code or toolkits, remove them with `git rm -r --cached <folder>`
3. Update `.gitignore` to exclude unwanted folders
4. The repository should only have ~25 JSON files total

### .gitignore Must Include:
```
NPLearn/
JPLearning/
nplearn_auto_data/
.dns_system/
auto_app_data generation/
app_icone.png
```

## Development Workflow

### Data Generation:
- Use `nplearn_auto_data/toolkit` for generating new learning data
- Generate data locally, test it, then copy to data folders
- Only push the final JSON files to GitHub

### Local Development:
- Keep app source code in `NPLearn/` folder (local only)
- Keep reference app in `JPLearning/` folder (local only)
- Keep toolkits in `nplearn_auto_data/` (local only)

### Git Workflow:
```bash
# Good workflow:
cd nplearning/
# ... edit JSON files ...
git add nplearning/
git commit -m "Update Nepali learning data"
git push

# Bad workflow - DON'T DO THIS:
git add NPLearn/
git add nplearn_auto_data/
git commit -m "Update app"  # ❌ WRONG! Don't push app code!
```

## Remember:
**GitHub = Data Only**
**Local = Everything (apps, toolkits, data)**
